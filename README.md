## nvmbuilder

Build flash blocks from a layout file (TOML/YAML/JSON) and an Excel workbook, then emit hex files.

```bash
nvmbuilder block@examples/block.toml -x examples/data.xlsx -o out
```

Run `nvmbuilder --help` for all available options. Example layouts and data are in the `examples/` directory.
