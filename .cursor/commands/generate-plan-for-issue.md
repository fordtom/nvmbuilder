Read the given Linear ticket (given in the format LIN-123), then read the current codebase. Once you have a good understanding of the task and the current state of the code, create an implementation plan. It should cover:

- Adding/changing any dependencies
- Any possible/necessary architectural changes
- A high level overview of the code changes required in each module
- Any changes required in the test cases
- If we're implementing a new feature, then adding at least one test case for it
