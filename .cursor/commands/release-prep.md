Prepare for a new release by doing the following:

- Ensuring `cargo test` passes
- Ensuring `cargo build --release` has no issues or warnings
- Run `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` and note all warnings

If any warnings or errors come up during these steps, take note of them and suggest fixes once you've finished your checks.
